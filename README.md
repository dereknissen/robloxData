## ROBLOX Experimental Analysis

The user data for my ROBLOX experiences is stored in Google Firebase as a realtime database. I thought it would be cool to extract the data, clean the data, and organize the data as I have learned to do in class. I used a very small data set from a WIP experience.

As you can see, I imported the data from the robloxData.json file into the Jupyter notebook file. I preceded by flipping the columns and rows, setting the user ID as the unique key, and then utilizing an API to retrieve the ROBLOX usernames. This way, I was able to create a leaderboard of the top 10 money earners in the database.

Very simple project, but I though it was fun to apply my class knowledge to what I do outside of class.
